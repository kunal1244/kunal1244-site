Since a major chunk of the month has already passed, I thought I might as well cheat and present them all together :p.\nSince this would be a really long read, I thought I’d rather break it into 2 parts of 15 songs each for better comprehensibility. I’ve also mentioned the albums in parentheses of specific tracks I’ve listed, so you can check them out as a whole.</p>\n<p>I’d also like to mention that I’ve predominantly mentioned songs in English, and it is not due to any bias against the Hindi Music Industry. It’s just that most Hindi songs somehow find a way to our playlists every time, but good music in the West is something I’ve been actively trying to find out about, so this is a result of my exploits. I’ll make a separate Hindi one later maybe.</p>\n<p>Here is my list, let me know yours, and what is it exactly about a particular song that inspires you.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>A song that reminds you of summertime</strong> — Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino’s ‘<em>Feels Like Summer</em>’ (single) also released as ‘42.26’ in his most recent album 3.15.20 (amazing btw, check it out!).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I mean, why not. Amazing production by Ludwig Göransson (who also gave us the Black Panther discography, a modern legend), a brilliant message about Global Warming, in addition to a mindblowing music video take this record as close to perfection as it could be.</p>\n<p>Close Misses — <em>Saturday Sun</em> and <em>Riptide</em> by Vance Joy, <em>Little Talks</em> by Of Monsters and Men (not a summer song per se, but I discovered it last summer so yeah, checks out)</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>A song you like with a number in its title</strong> — <em>93 ’til Infinity</em> by Souls of Mischief, released as a single and a record in an album of the same name.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the sickest and most underrated beats in the 90’s Alternate genre, especially when Gangsta Rap was at the top of its game, the song is a production masterclass. That this turned out to be one of the most influential albums in hip-hop history is no surprise whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Close Misses — <em>Shook Ones, Part II</em> by Mobb Deep (objectively a better song, but way too overplayed), <em>Bound 2</em> by Kanye West (Well pre-Kardashian Kanye was the real deal)</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>A song you like with a color in the title</strong> — <em>Black Dog</em> by the legendary Led Zeppelin, as part of ‘Led Zeppelin-IV’, a multi-platinum certified album (well what Zeppelin album isn’t).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Bonzo’s crazy but accurate rhythm coupled with Jimmy Page’s ridiculous skills on a riff created by John Paul Jones could be a great hit in itself, but Plant’s screeching yet surprisingly coherent vocals make it one of their best records ever. No wonder it was a fan favorite in all of their concerts.</p>\n<p>Close Miss — <em>Black Skinhead</em> by Kanye West(Yeezus)</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>A song that reminds you of someone you’d rather forget</strong> — Well, anything by Kesha, Justin Beiber, and Demi Lovato, among many more in the massy pop genre (I mean I don’t hate all pop artists, but some were just cringe tbh). All of these remind me of my earlier teens where I would blast these every day, a part of me I’d gladly wipe out of my memory given a chance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Close Miss — Prateek Kuhad. Not gonna lie, did like a few of his compositions here and there, but that dude is way overrated. I’d rather forget anyone who believes he’s the new face of Indian indie pop, there are much better acts than him out there.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>A song that needs to be played loud</strong> — Ah, easy-peasy. Literally any song by Siddhu Moose Wala or Bohemia, or other artists in the consumable Punjabi hip-hop genre (excluding ‘artists’ like Badshah). A major shoutout to my Northie friends for introducing me to this.</li>\n<li><strong>A song that makes you want to dance</strong> — <em>Can’t Stop the Feeling</em> by Justin Timberlake.\nThe song is brimming with infectious positive energy, always tend to move my hands and legs inadvertently when listening to it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Close Misses — All Daler Mehndi and Pharell Williams tracks.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>A song to drive to</strong> — Depends really. If I go the generic ‘long drive through the fields’ route though, the Lumineers are great. Can’t pick a single song from their discography, all sort of sound the same really.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, if we go the ‘returning home after a long day in the office’ route, I’d pick Lord Huron, Vance Joy, or Of Monsters and Men. Though they have a varied discography, I’d put on any track really, the soothing and mellow music is all I would require after a hectic day.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong>A song about drugs and alcohol</strong> — <em>N.Y. State of Mind</em> by Nas (Illmatic).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A major chunk of 90’s gangsta rap dealt with the evergrowing crack abuse, and its negative effects on the predominantly ghetto black community. Nas perfectly summarizes the NY East Coast situation in this track, and it is a recurrent theme throughout Illmatic.</p>\n<p>Close Misses — Any track from the hugely popular album Ready to Die by Notorious B.I.G.</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><strong>A song that makes you happy</strong> — <em>Here Comes The Sun</em> by The Beatles (Abbey Road).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The intro lead to the song played by Paul McCartney, and the sheer innocent simplicity of its lyrics never fails to put a smile to my face.</p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><strong>A song that makes you sad</strong> — Any track from Donuts, the final album by J Dilla, the GOAT producer.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Listening to Donuts leaves me awestruck and sad at the same time. It’s the definition of leaving on a high, J Dilla died 3 days after releasing his final and incomparable brilliant masterpiece, of a rare infection.</p>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li><strong>A song you never get tired of</strong> — Well this is tough, ’cause there are a lot of them. But the 2 major ones would be <em>Redbone</em> by Childish Gambino (Awaken, My Love!), and <em>Blame Game</em> by John Legend and Kanye (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Redbone intro loop is the smoothest of them all, plus a high-pitched Troy (Community reference, watch it if you don’t get it) is all we ever wanted and needed. And though Blame Game has pretty impressive productions behind it (The whole of MBDTF does in fact), the Chris Rock outro skit is the real deal for me. Never gets old.</p>\n<p>Close Misses — <em>C.R.E.A.M.</em> by the Wu-Tang Clan (Enter the Wu-Tang — 36 Chambers), any track by A Tribe Called Quest, or the Legendary Roots Crew, 2 of the OG group acts of hip-hop.</p>\n<ol start=\"12\">\n<li><strong>A song from your pre-teen years</strong> — <em>Call Me Maybe</em> by Carly Rae Jepsen\nBlast this song when I’m around and watch me transform into a crazy little kid, shouting out all the lyrics, in sync.</li>\n<li><strong>A song you like from the 70s</strong> — <em>Time</em> by Pink Floyd (The Dark Side of The Moon)\nNothing much to say here. Pure Classic. David Gilmour and his solos are the GOAT, period. If you’ve not heard of it, you are probably living under a rock. Please do me a favor and listen to the entire album in one go.</li>\n<li><strong>A song you’d love to be played at your wedding</strong> — Not much scope there to be honest. A Bengali Wedding is too formal for such puny events. However, I’d be pretty psyched to have Jimmy Page’s solo in <em>Stairway to Heaven’s Extended 10-minute live version</em> play in the background. That’d be mad.</li>\n<li><strong>A song you like that’s a cover by another artist</strong> — Kurt Cobain’s live version of A Man Who Sold The World by David Bowie, at the 1994 MTV Awards (Unplugged Session). It’s wild to imagine that Cobain’s raspiness would so artistically compliment the song.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The remaining 15 songs will be in the next blog post.
