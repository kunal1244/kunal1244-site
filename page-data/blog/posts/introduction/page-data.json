I’m more of a curious, intuitive geek who likes to think he actually has an idea of what he wants in life. However, I’m not as creepy as I may sound. I love to meet new people, know their thought processes, and make friends with the ones I find interesting. My closer friends describe me as an interesting personality, so I’d be happy to latch onto that.</p>\n<p>I recently started writing articles and short texts for a task I’d been given, and realized that I actually loved the work. It really helped, not just because I could give my opinion on topics which I think are important, it also gave me the motivation, the incentive to actually research and enhance my knowledge on the topic itself.</p>\n<p>The topics I choose will definitely not be limited to a few genre, and rather span over various ones, sport, music, politics, education being just a few of them. I certainly do not expect everyone who gives them a read to actually take a few moments and give an honest feedback but hey, why not?</p>\n<p>I would also love to interact with you, just give me a ping at my Facebook ID, your insight would be really appreciated.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/introduction","tagSlugs":["/blog/tag/introduction/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-03-18T23:46:37.121Z","description":"A little something about myself, and an introduction to this blog.","tags":["Introduction"],"title":"Introduction","socialImage":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/posts/introduction"}}}
