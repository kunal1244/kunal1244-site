People here are judged based on their\ncaste, creed, and the religion they belong to, hence while your appearance and\nwords may not always be the reflections of your beliefs and your “status” in the\nsociety, but the symbols you carry along give you away. In case you’ve not already\nfigured it out, the most obvious symbol which comes to our mind when we talk\nof this judgmental state is food. Though the food groups may crudely be divided\ninto the vegetarians, and the non-vegetarians, it is not quite that simple out here\nin India, is it?</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/veg1.jpg\" alt=\"How India eats.\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-actual-lines-of-classification\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-actual-lines-of-classification\" aria-label=\"the actual lines of classification permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The actual lines of classification</h2>\n<p>Firstly, let’s get a little catch-up on the theme. Vegetarians are basically people who consume only plant products, and alongside dairy products like milk, cheese, butter etc. The ones who also add eggs to their diet are ovo-vegetarians. If you’ve heard of the term vegans, these are the people who abstain themselves even from the dairy products. While India is looked upon by the West as a majorly vegetarian  country, the stats show otherwise. About 71% Indians consider themselves non-vegetarian, but ironically enough, the remaining vegetarians are greater than the combined might overseas! Hence it is not wrong at all to infer that India can safely be assumed to be the hub of vegetarianism, and this is exactly where a situation starts to develop.</p>\n<p>While this classification seems quite sleek and simple, the application often leads to communal disruption. The thing is we Indians are really proud of our culture. “Proud &#x26; vain” to be precise, though. It really is outrageous and laughable at the same time to see such puny issues be the origin of something as huge as the recent beef-ban chaos. Why, if even eggs (optional at that, in case you’re wondering!) being served to actually needy children, through a government\nmandated mid-day meal scheme can be the source of disruption in a country home to the largest number of severely malnourished children; it is hard to imagine more fragile morals from these so-called “protectors” of their cultures. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/veg2.jpg\" alt=\"Indian schoolchildren having their mid-day meal.\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-role-of-caste-hierarchy\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-role-of-caste-hierarchy\" aria-label=\"the role of caste hierarchy permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The role of caste hierarchy</h2>\n<p>What has rendered our society so insensitive, so inhumane that food, one of the very basic amenities of life has been sparking divisions? While the thought may be seconded by emotion and sentiment, we do need to analyze what the root causes might be. The very old and prevalent caste\nhierarchy plays a major role here. The sense of purity attached with vegetarian food calls for distance, both social and physical, from its counterpart and Brahmins, were, and still are staunch advocates of the theory. And moreover, more and more communities are coming in support\nof this totally baseless argument, as they desperately want themselves to be in confederation with their so-called superiors, the Brahmins.</p>\n<p>Political parties draw inspiration, and these very insignificant issues start evoking a national sentiment. We need to ask ourselves why the ideas of ‘pollution’ and ‘purity’ are unquestioningly accepted and why an instinct of disgust for non-vegetarian food is blindly cultivated — even by the younger, modern, educated lot —when it only supports an insane, outdated exclusion, often along the lines of caste and religion. Many are indeed not sure why\nthey react that way, except for the fact that they were raised to do so. </p>\n<h2 id=\"vegetarian-hegemony\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#vegetarian-hegemony\" aria-label=\"vegetarian hegemony permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Vegetarian Hegemony</h2>\n<p>Let’s explore a case of vegetarian hegemony. The BJP, a political party in India built around the upper-caste Hindus obsessed with cow-protection, has been, for a few years, trying to show support to an equally non-vegetarian hating community, the Jains, by imposing a ban on the abattoirs in Mumbai for a certain period during “Paryushan Parv”, the Jain festival. This definitely was a strategic move, considering the BJP, a party which derives its funds and standing from the Gujaratis and the Marwaris, of which a significant population follows Jainism. </p>\n<p>However, the Shiv Sena and the Sangh took offence, representing the Maharashtrians, who consume poultry and fish on a regular basis, which are also wary of the growing control of these communities over the market, industry etc. However, as a direct consequence of vegetarian hegemony, firstly, “Roti”, a restaurant, was made to shut down through harsh protests by the Jains, and renowned food-chains like the McDonalds, Starbucks were made to change their outlets so as to shift to a purely veg menu. The issue reached a new high, when there were reports of landlords barging into rented flats any time of the day to check whether the tenant was either cooking or storing non-vegetarian food. This has led to palpable tension over the years between resident communities. </p>\n<p>Thus, political parties, sure, have a major hand in sparking these divisions. They will always search for the best possible situations to appeal to the sentiments of their vote banks. The recent ban for the slaughter of cattle again proved to be the catalyst, with the Kerala Youth Congress members slaughtering a cow publicly. Ironically, while most of these protestors would\nturn out to be Hindus defending beef, the media, including the word of mouth will popularize and evoke the anti-Muslim sentiment. And people will be outraged, come out on streets, protest, kill a few of their own species, it is all really normal in this country.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/veg3.jpg\" alt=\"Indian God Krishna placed inside a cattle shed, suggesting the reverence of cows in Indian culture\"></p>\n<p>Finally, an appeal to all of you out there, have your views, constructively criticize and argue, but if you can’t respect the basic interests and needs of your fellow citizens, you shouldn’t even bother.
