Here are the final 15 themes that I cover as part of this routine. Let me know your answers too!</p>\n<ol start=\"16\">\n<li><strong>A song that is a classic favorite</strong> — Has to be <em>Sultans of Swing</em> by the Dire Straits(Sultans Of Swing / Eastbound Train) in the Pre-Rock era and <em>Juicy</em> by Biggie Smalls(Ready to Die) in the hip-hop genre.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Mark Knopfler’s skills on the guitar are unmatched really, or at least among the same ranks as Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton. It is a nightmare to perfectly replicate on the guitar even for professional guitarists with years of experience, although it is equally pleasant to savor those smooth transitions between bends, and the equally mesmerizing background support.</p>\n<p>There’s just one word to describe any Biggie track — FLOW. He was the King of East-Coast, who wrote lyrics that would come to inspire generations of rappers after him, and delivered them as smoothly as a red-hot knife on butter. There was no equal when he was at his peak.</p>\n<p>Close Misses — <em>Another Brick in the Wall, Part-II</em> by Pink Floyd(The Wall), <em>Snow, Hey Oh</em> by Red Hot Chili Peppers (Stadium Arcadium).</p>\n<ol start=\"17\">\n<li><strong>A song you’d sing a duet with someone on karaoke</strong> — <em>Love the Way You Lie</em> by Eminem, vocals by Rihanna (Recovery).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This song is close to me, as I’d do this very frequently in school. A friend of mine killed Em’s verses, while I sufficiently backed him with Rihanna’s high-pitched vocals (My friends know I possess a great falsetto XD).</p>\n<ol start=\"18\">\n<li><strong>A song from the year you were born</strong> — <em>Nas Is Like</em> by Nas(single), released March 1999.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I mean I’ve got to have a song on this list by my favorite artist of all time (Even my ringtone is a sample from The World is Yours, the best Nas track to date in my opinion). The best lyricist of hip-hop history collaborating with DJ Premier tried to recreate the magic they put out together in the form of Illmatic in ’94, and boy were they successful.</p>\n<ol start=\"19\">\n<li><strong>A song that makes you think about life</strong> — <em>The Yawning Grave</em> by Lord Huron(Strange Trails).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That song gives me chills, yo. An eerie yet serene background and Ben Schneider’s haunting vocals make it one of the best songs I’ve heard yet. Very similar to another track by the same band, Vide Noir, from an album with the same name.</p>\n<ol start=\"20\">\n<li><strong>A song that has many meanings to you</strong> — Didn’t really understand the theme very well, but a song which I really admire, and which has various hues and angles to it, is <em>November Rain</em> by Guns N’ Roses (Use Your Illusion I). Starts off really happy and takes a very dark turn indeed, with an amazing solo by Slash which has millions of covers on YouTube.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If this was a philosophical theme and needed a song that conveyed different meanings to me individually, I’d pass as I’m really not much of a deep thinker.</p>\n<ol start=\"21\">\n<li><strong>A song you like with a person’s name in the title</strong> — Does <em>Still D.R.E.</em> (2001) count?\nDr. Dre is one of the most influential producer-rappers in hip-hop history, and this was his perfect return to the forefront after The Chronic’s widespread acclaim in 1992. Plus hey, there aren’t many average collaborations between him and Snoop, so yeah this was bound to be a hit. Dope-ass beat though, check it out.</li>\n<li><strong>A song that moves you forward</strong> — <em>Fire and the Flood</em> by Vance Joy and <em>Hall of Fame</em> by The Script, without question.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Though I generally admire all of Vance’s songs equally, this hits different in a very positive way. Also, The Script generally write meaningful songs and having Will.I.Am from the Black Eyed Peas join them just makes it an awesome collaborative effort.</p>\n<ol start=\"23\">\n<li><strong>A song you think everybody should listen to</strong> — Not a song, but a phenomenon. Please listen to Linkin Park. Just do it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Well I mean if you were born in the 90s you must have already listened to them. Do it again, can’t stress it enough (You can skip the album One More Light if you’re an out-and-out metal-head, but listen to it anyway I guess, it’s not half as bad as it is made out to be). Call it my personal bias, but LP is the greatest alt-rock band to ever grace the earth. Also, RIP\nChester :(</p>\n<ol start=\"24\">\n<li><strong>A song by a band you wish were still together</strong> — <em>Hotel California</em> by the Eagles(Album — Hotel California).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Fine, I get it. Very cliché, but who cares, it’s a great song. Don Felder and Joe Walsh were the heart and soul of the group, and once Don was let out after a dragged-out fiasco, it really wasn’t the same anymore. Amazing song though, check it out if you haven’t already heard it a billion times over.</p>\n<ol start=\"25\">\n<li><strong>A song you like by an artist no longer living</strong> — Woah that is not a very potent constraint. This could be a list, but I’m gonna stick to one. <em>Come As You Are</em> by Nirvana (Nevermind). Will leave it at that. Kurt Cobain, you goddamn legend.</li>\n<li><strong>A song that makes you want to fall in love</strong> — Well you must have understood my love for Lord Huron by now. This has to be one of my favorite indie tracks, <em>When The Night Is Over</em> (Vide Noir). No more explanation, listen to the song, you’ll get it.</li>\n<li><strong>A song that breaks your heart</strong> — <em>Make it Rain</em> by Foy Vance, covered by Ed Sheeran for the TV show ‘Sons of Anarchy’.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The lyrics are painful, and the music is sad, however, if I may say so, borderline sultry. Listen to Foy Vance’s version, where he sang it live at Bangor Abbey, and you’ll lose your mind. Blues Rock at its best.</p>\n<ol start=\"28\">\n<li><strong>A song by an artist whose voice you love</strong> — Keira Knightley has the voice of a nightingale. Don’t believe it? Listen to her version of <em>Lost Stars</em> from the movie Begin Again (a clichéd choice again, but it’s really that good). Enthralling to say the least. The Adam Levine version is pretty great too.</li>\n<li><strong>A song you remember from your childhood</strong> — <em>Smack That</em> by Akon(Konvicted).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This brings back memories. The first English song I had memorized all the lyrics to, and being able to sing the whole of it was an achievement like none other back then.</p>\n<ol start=\"30\">\n<li><strong>A song that reminds you of yourself</strong> — That’s deep. <em>What They Do</em> by the Legendary Roots Crew(Illadelph Halflife)?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Okay, you caught me, I just mentioned a banger of the top of my head, didn’t think too much into it. Though if I do have to mention similarities between the track and my personality, I’d say the precision and clarity on production, a bit of funk throughout the song, and Black Thought’s raw intelligence on the lyrics. Couldn’t find anything wrong with the song though, which is rarely the case with me.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/song-challenge-ii","tagSlugs":["/blog/tag/hip-hop/","/blog/tag/nas/","/blog/tag/lord-huron/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-06-21T22:40:32.169Z","description":"I came across an amusing challenge while browsing social media a while ago, which was to identify a song based on themes/scenarios every day for one month.
