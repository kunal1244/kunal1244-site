The day belonged to a lanky left-arm seamer, who had endured a seriously sprained ankle just 2 days ago.The figures he returned were an astounding 6 for 23, that while bowling out his 10 overs straight against England. Ashish Nehra’s spell was a lesson in the art of seam bowling itself, with Alec Stewart being his only scalp not dismissed in the slip cordon. The dream performance remained his best by a mile, which says a lot about a career which ended recently, with the man being 38, an age by which almost any cricketer would have already hung up his boots. The career was, however, ravaged by injuries, which led to the end of his fledgling test career at 2005, comprising of just 17 tests.</p>\n<p>But was such a rugged, seemingly inconsequential career really so irrelevant? Does an average of 42.40 in Tests reflect just the ineffectiveness of a left armer who regularly hit the 140s with the frail physicality he had?</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/ashish-nehra1.jpg\" alt=\"Ashish Nehra celebrating during his career-defining spell at Durban, 2003\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"injury-layoffs-and-comeback\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#injury-layoffs-and-comeback\" aria-label=\"injury layoffs and comeback permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Injury layoffs and comeback</h2>\n<p>With Nehraji, it was always was about putting up with his fragile structure, and his sheer denial to give up on pace that defined his career. An athlete so prone to injuries, having had 12 surgeries, Yuvraj Singh once joked, “ Ashish Nehra is the player who would get himself injured even while sleeping.” Frustrating more so were the timings of injuries, which usually occurred when Nehraji was in his rhythm, and was making real impact. Why, even his Durban spell ended with him throwing up by the side of the pitch, while he was nursing a swollen ankle. But the torrid journey has made him mentally strong, so strong that he was able to make an amazing comeback to the Indian T20 side aged 36, on the back of two hugely successful IPL seasons. He went on to become one of the top bowlers in the World T20 2016. “What works for me is my experience obviously. I know my limitations, but I always back myself. The confidence comes from the fact that I have done enough behind-the-scenes work”, he says.</p>\n<p>Nehra’s career has had its ups too, with him picking 31 wickets in 2009, following it up with 28 scalps the next year, to end up No. 2 on the world ODI wickets chart, which guaranteed him a place in the World Cup squad for 2011. He regrets turning down the offer by the then Test captain MS Dhoni and national coach Gary Kirsten to play Tests in 2009, as he felt his body could not have handled the workload of bowling 20 overs an innings. “I could have worked on my fitness harder, was just 30”, he sighs. He never complained though, “If I am doing well, I am the same guy; if I am not doing well, I am the same guy. Definitely, when you are not doing well, you do think about your game and what is going wrong, and then you think, “What can I do better?”.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/ashish-nehra2.jpg\" alt=\"Ashish Nehra nursing an injury during a Sunrisers Hyderabad match.\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-pace-issue-in-india\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-pace-issue-in-india\" aria-label=\"the pace issue in india permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The pace issue in India</h2>\n<p>The secret lies in bowling yorkers, he believes. According to him, the failure of strong teams\nsuch as South Africa, Australia and England to be consistent in the shortest format directly\npoints to the lack of quality bowlers at the death, who can deliver pacy yet accurate yorkers\nat will.Why India has been lacking in the pace department, according to him is not due to\nlack of talent, but sub-par management and support. Someone like Mitchell Starc is provided\nwith world-class facilities to preserve him, is given ample rest, which is something that Indian\npacers lack. He admires Chaminda Vaas, the Sri Lankan seamer, for being able to survive\nas long as he did, in pitches tailor-made to suit Murlidharan and Dharmasena, coupled with\nthe hot and humid conditions, while picking a mammoth 400 ODI wickets. Umesh Yadav,\nbeing able to bowl throughout India’s home season, that at a wonderful pace too, signifies\nthe growing awareness of the issue.</p>\n<h2 id=\"development-of-a-lethal-pace-attack\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#development-of-a-lethal-pace-attack\" aria-label=\"development of a lethal pace attack permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Development of a lethal pace-attack</h2>\n<p>The Indian team, however, has scaled a new peak from the last 2 seasons, which experts\nbelieve has a lot to do with the recent rise among the seamers, both in quantity and quality.\nSupremely talented individuals including Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Jaydev Unadkat,\nBarinder Sran, Mohammed Siraj have made it to the national squad, and have been performing\nbrilliantly at the topmost level, while the stalwarts in the likes of Mohammad Shami,\nBhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav have established themselves among the elite playing\ntoday across the world. The rise has been fairly synonymous with the admission of Nehra into the squad, while he himself\nhas been one of the top performers. Nehra had become the father-figure in the team with a\nnew-found pace attack of Bumrah, Pandya and Kumar. In the unforgettable match against\nBangladesh in the World T20, where India defended 2 runs off the last 3 balls, Nehra was the\none in control of the situation. A young Hardik Pandya would see the perfect fields set for his\nballs while Kohli, Dhoni and Yuvraj would simply listen to his advice and act accordingly.\nThe T20 attack was one of the best in the world, and under Nehra’s guidance it flourished,\nwith Bumrah entering the top 5 in the world rankings.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/ashish-nehra3.jpg\" alt=\"Nehra during the infamous match vs Bangladesh in the 2016 World T20.\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"legacy\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#legacy\" aria-label=\"legacy permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Legacy</h2>\n<p>Nehra’s legacy does not entirely remain behind those figures, but also in the way he has\ninspired a generation to continue persevering, whatever be the odds is golden. Javagal\nSrinath, the legendary pacer, in honour of Nehra’s phenomenal career said, “This is the\nsaddest retirement the sport has had to see since Sachin Tendulkar and will leave a hole that\ncannot be filled. His expertise, way of mentoring the team, and leading from the shadows will\nnever be forgotten by any of the team members.” On the eve of his swansong match, Delhi &#x26;\nDistrict Cricket Association renamed one of the ends of the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground as\n“Ashish Nehra End” and thus Nehra becoming second bowler in the cricket history after\nJames Anderson (cricketer) to have bowled from the end named after him. </p>\n<p>He has now made a move to commentary, which is perfect for him as his teammates regard\nhim as a naturally funny being. He still makes trips to his boyhood club, Sonnet, a club which\nhas given many greats to Indian cricket. Smart-phones are not his cup of tea, he admits, and\nwhen asked what fans like about him, he simply answers, “Fans do not like me much.”</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/ashish-nehra-a-legend","tagSlugs":["/blog/tag/cricket/","/blog/tag/reminiscence/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-03-22T23:46:37.121Z","description":"Is Ashish Nehra just the sum of his performances on the field?
